# odin-signup-form

My solution to the "Sign-up form" project of The Odin Project.<br>
<br>
Tried to incorporate what I learned as much as possible.<br>
The code is a bit verbose and long, because I tried to use css selectors instead of just giving my divs and spans classes & ids.<br>
Will revise it later when I learn more about JS form validation.<br>
